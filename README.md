# Capabilities

Implements the concept of capabilities as part of the robots-in-concert system.

## Building

Build it in a catkin workspace or build it stand alone:

```bash
$ source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ source ./devel/setup.bash
```

## Running a demo

You can setup a demo of sorts using one of the test fixtures.

### Starting the capability server

Start the capability server with the demo.launch file:

```bash
$ roslaunch capabilities demo.launch
```

This is equivalent to running a roscore and then this:

```bash
$ capability_server `rospack find capabilities`/test/discovery_workspaces/minimal
```

This starts the capability server which crawls the `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH` and looks for packages which export capabilities. In this case it should find the `minimal_pkg` package in the `test/discovery_workspaces` folder. You can look at the `package.xml` of `minimal_pkg` to see how it defines its capabilities:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package>
  ...
  <export>
    <capability_interface>
      interfaces/Minimal.yaml
    </capability_interface>
    <capability_provider>
      providers/minimal.yaml
    </capability_provider>
    <semantic_capability_interface>
      interfaces/SpecificMinimal.yaml
    </semantic_capability_interface>
    <capability_provider>
      providers/specific_minimal.yaml
    </capability_provider>

  </export>
</package>
```

It defines one capability interface, `minimal_pkg/Minimal`, and a semantic interface called `minimal_pkg/SpecificMinimal`. It also provides a capability provider for each of those interfaces. Looking at the `minimal_pkg/Minimal` interface spec file:

```yaml
%YAML 1.1
---
name: Minimal
spec_version: 1
spec_type: interface
interface: {}
```

It basically fills out only the explicitly required fields (it's minimal after all).

You can also take a look at the `minimal_pkg/minimal` provider:

```yaml
%YAML 1.1
---
name: minimal
spec_version: 1
spec_type: provider
implements: minimal_pkg/Minimal
launch_file: 'launch/minimal.launch'
```

You can see that this provider specifies that it implements the `minimal_pkg/Minimal` interface, and it has a launch file, which is specified relatively from the `minimal_pkg/minimal` spec file. This launch file simply runs a dummy script:

```xml
<launch>
    <node name="minimal" pkg="minimal_pkg" type="minimal.py" output="screen" />
</launch>
```

Which just prints and publishes a message periodically and then stops after 10 seconds:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String


def minimal():
    pub = rospy.Publisher('chatter', String)
    rospy.init_node('minimal')
    start = rospy.Time.now()
    while not rospy.is_shutdown() and (rospy.Time.now() - start).to_sec() < 10:
        str = "hello world %s" % rospy.get_time()
        rospy.loginfo(str)
        pub.publish(String(str))
        rospy.sleep(1.0)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        minimal()
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass

```

### Testing out the capability server

Now there should be some key ROS services available:

```bash
$ rosservice list --nodes | grep /capability_server
/get_interfaces /capability_server
/get_providers /capability_server
/get_semantic_interfaces /capability_server
/reload_capabilities /capability_server
/start_capability /capability_server
/stop_capability /capability_server
```

You can call these services to query, start, and stop capabilities.

You can list the available interfaces:

```bash
$ rosservice call /get_interfaces
interfaces: ['minimal_pkg/Minimal']
```

You can also list the providers for an interface:

```bash
$ rosservice call /get_providers Minimal
providers: ['minimal_pkg/minimal']
```

Start one with this command line:

```bash
$ rosservice call /start_capability minimal_pkg/Minimal minimal_pkg/minimal
successful: True
```

This is telling the capability server to start the `minimal_pkg/Minimal` capability, preferring the `minimal_pkg/minimal` provider.

You can switch back to the `capability_server` and see that it is printing the message to the screen. After 10 seconds this node should shutdown normally, but you will get an error message like this:

```

```

This is because from the `capability_server`'s perspective the launch file it ran shutdown unexpectedly. This is normal for this launch file, but probably an error for most launch files which are designed to run forever, until stopped.

### Stopping a capability

If you run the capability again:

```bash
$ rosservice call /start_capability minimal_pkg/Minimal minimal_pkg/minimal
successful: True
```

And then within 10 seconds call:

```bash
$ rosservice call /stop_capability minimal_pkg/Minimal
successful: True
```

The `capability_server` will preempt the provider currently running for the `minimal_pkg/Minimal` interface, if one is running. In this case we just launched the `minimal_pkg/minimal` provider so it will be shutdown prematurely:

```

These are the basics, more details about the specifications and chaining capabilities in the future.
